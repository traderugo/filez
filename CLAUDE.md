Important

When generating code for this project, always follow the offline-first architecture defined in this file.

Prioritize local IndexedDB reads and writes before any server communication.

The application should behave like a desktop application:

- instant UI updates
- minimal loading states
- minimal server usage
- background synchronization

Never block UI interactions while waiting for network responses.

This project does not use TypeScript. All code should be written in JavaScript.

---

Project Architecture

This project uses a local-first / offline-first architecture.

The browser acts as the primary database and compute engine.

The backend (Supabase / serverless APIs) is used only for:

- authentication
- persistent storage
- cross-device synchronization

Core Workflow

User Action
→ Write to IndexedDB
→ Update derived tables
→ UI updates instantly
→ Add operation to "syncQueue"
→ Background sync sends changes to server

The UI should never depend on server responses to update.

---

Local Database

Primary database: IndexedDB

Recommended library: Dexie.js

Typical tables:

- "transactions"
- "categoryTotals"
- "dashboardStats"
- "monthlyTotals"
- "syncQueue"

Rules

- All CRUD operations write to IndexedDB first
- UI reads only from IndexedDB
- Server responses must never control UI rendering

---

Repository Pattern

All database mutations must go through repository functions.

Repositories are responsible for:

- writing to IndexedDB
- updating derived tables
- adding operations to the sync queue

Example pattern:

async function createTransaction(tx) {
  await db.transactions.add(tx)

  await updateCategoryTotals(tx)

  await db.syncQueue.add({
    operation: "CREATE",
    table: "transactions",
    payload: tx,
    createdAt: Date.now()
  })
}

UI components should never write directly to IndexedDB.

They should call repository methods.

---

Derived Tables

Dashboards must never scan large tables.

Instead maintain derived tables that store summaries.

Examples:

- "categoryTotals"
- "dashboardStats"
- "monthlyTotals"

These tables are updated when underlying data changes.

Benefits:

- instant dashboard rendering
- minimal calculations during reads
- reduced CPU usage
- reduced server load

---

UI Data Access

UI should read only from IndexedDB.

Reactive queries should be used so the UI updates automatically when the database changes.

Example:

useLiveQuery(() => db.transactions.toArray())

Benefits:

- instant UI updates
- offline functionality
- minimal API calls
- predictable rendering

---

Heavy Calculations

Heavy calculations must not run on the UI thread.

Use Web Workers for:

- analytics
- aggregations
- financial calculations
- large dataset processing

Typical flow:

IndexedDB query
→ send data to worker
→ worker processes data
→ worker returns result
→ UI updates

This prevents UI freezing when datasets grow.

---

IndexedDB Performance Rules

To support large datasets, follow these rules:

1. Always index queried fields.
2. Avoid full table scans.
3. Use compound indexes when filtering multiple fields.
4. Limit query sizes where possible.
5. Use pagination for large datasets.
6. Keep records small and normalized.

Example schema:

db.version(1).stores({
  transactions: "id, userId, category, date"
})

Example indexed query:

db.transactions
  .where("userId")
  .equals(userId)
  .toArray()

---

Sync Queue

All mutations must be recorded in "syncQueue".

Example record:

{
  operation: "CREATE",
  table: "transactions",
  payload: {...},
  createdAt: timestamp
}

This enables eventual consistency with the server.

---

Background Sync Engine

The sync engine periodically sends queued operations to the server.

Operations should be batched into a single request.

Example pattern:

async function sync() {
  const pending = await db.syncQueue.toArray()

  if (!pending.length) return

  await fetch("/api/sync", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(pending)
  })

  for (const item of pending) {
    await db.syncQueue.delete(item.id)
  }
}

Batching reduces:

- serverless executions
- API requests
- Supabase query load
- Vercel invocation costs

---

Optional Initial Data Sync

After login, the app may download the user's dataset once.

Example flow:

login
→ download dataset
→ store in IndexedDB
→ application runs locally

After this, most operations occur entirely on the client.

---

Server Responsibilities

The backend should handle only:

- authentication
- persistent storage
- cross-device synchronization

The server should not perform dashboard calculations.

All analytics and aggregation should happen in the browser.

---

Cost Optimization Goals

This architecture dramatically reduces backend usage.

Benefits include:

- far fewer API calls
- reduced Supabase reads/writes
- fewer serverless executions
- reduced Vercel costs

Heavy computation and data processing are handled locally.

---

Development Goal

The application should feel like a native desktop application:

- instant response times
- reactive UI updates
- smooth performance with large datasets
- minimal dependence on network connectivity

---

Code Generation Rules

When generating code for this project, always follow these rules:

1. Offline-first is mandatory
   
   - All writes go to IndexedDB first.
   - UI updates immediately from local state.

2. Never fetch inside UI components
   
   - Server communication must go through repository or sync logic.

3. Prefer local queries
   
   - UI reads must come from IndexedDB.

4. All mutations must enter the syncQueue
   
   - No direct server mutations.

5. Batch network requests
   
   - Avoid unnecessary API calls.

6. Avoid heavy work on the UI thread
   
   - Use Web Workers for analytics and large computations.

7. Optimize for large datasets
   
   - Always use indexed queries.
   - Avoid full table scans.

8. JavaScript only
   
   - Do not introduce TypeScript.

9. Prioritize desktop-level responsiveness

10. When uncertain, choose the solution that reduces server load and network usage.
