/**
 * Grant a station a subscription outright, without payment. Modelled on wacart's `grant_pro`
 * (wacart/app/api/admin/sellers/[id]/route.js), adapted to a schema that bills per service
 * rather than by plan.
 *
 * Three things differ from wacart's version, and each one is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. It writes subscription_items, one per active service. wacart has a single `plan_type`
 *    to flip; here /api/subscription-check gates every feature by looking for an item whose
 *    service_id matches, so a subscription with no items is "approved" and unlocks nothing.
 *
 * 2. user_id is the STATION OWNER, never the admin doing the granting. That same check joins
 *    on `subscriptions.user_id = organizations.owner_id`, so a row stamped with the admin's
 *    id would sit in the table looking correct and gate nothing.
 *
 * 3. Duration is in months, not wacart's days. end_date is month arithmetic throughout this
 *    schema, and the `months` column is what the approve path reads.
 *
 * The station is told, through station_messages, which is what its Notifications screen
 * reads. Silently granting access leaves the owner wondering why a locked feature opened.
