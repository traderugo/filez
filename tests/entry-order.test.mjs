/**
 * Reproduces the "entries reorder when saved and reopened" bug and pins the fix, across EVERY
 * multi-entry page rather than just daily-sales.
 *
 * The bug has two halves, and a page is only correct if it has both:
 *
 *   Save side. All entries in one batch were stamped with a single `new Date().toISOString()`,
 *   so createdAt tied and could not express order. orderedCreatedAt(baseMs, i) gives each a
 *   distinct, strictly increasing timestamp by its position in the form.
 *
 *   Load side. A day's entries were gathered with a plain filter and no sort, so they came back
 *   in whatever order the store returned them. The loader has to sort by createdAt.
 *
 * Fixing only one half does nothing: distinct timestamps that nobody sorts by still reopen
 * scattered, and a sort over tied timestamps is still arbitrary. So both are asserted per page.
 *
 * Source is read and evaluated rather than imported, so the test cannot drift from the
 * implementation. Was tests/daily-sales-order.test.mjs, when daily-sales was the only page
 * covered.
 *
 * Run: node tests/entry-order.test.mjs
