/**
 * The station's destinations, in one place.
 *
 * These lists used to live inside app/dashboard/stations/[stationId]/page.js, which was
 * fine while the hub was the only thing that navigated. A sidebar is a second consumer, and
 * two hand-maintained copies of "where can you go" drift the first time either is edited —
 * so the hub and the sidebar now read the same arrays.
 *
 * `pageKey` is the permission key checked against a member's visible_pages. An owner sees
 * everything; a restricted member sees only the keys they hold.
 *
 * ── A known gap, deliberately preserved here rather than quietly fixed ──────────────────
 * ENTRY_PERMISSION_OPTIONS / REPORT_PERMISSION_OPTIONS are what the permissions UI offers,
 * and they do NOT cover every destination: report-sales-overview, report-inventory-log and
 * report-analytics have no toggle. Because access is `isOwner || visiblePages.includes(key)`
 * and those keys can never be granted, restricted staff can never open those three reports.
 * That is a real bug, but fixing it widens what staff can see on a live system, so it is
 * surfaced here (see MISSING_PERMISSION_KEYS) rather than changed as a side effect of
 * moving code. store-portal hit exactly this with its `expenses` key.

/**
 * The reports, grouped by domain, mirroring store-portal's REPORT_SECTIONS
 * (app/business/[slug]/reports/page.js). Eleven rows in one undifferentiated block is a list
 * you scan rather than a list you navigate.
 *
 * Built by picking pageKeys out of REPORT_LINKS rather than restating the destinations, so a
 * report added there cannot go missing here, and href/icon/desc have exactly one definition.
 *
 * Grouped by what each report CONTAINS, not what it is called:
 *   - Daily Sales Report is a per-day fuel operations sheet (pumps, tanks, lodgements, cash),
 *     so it sits with Sales Operation, the per-shift version of the same job, under Sales.
 *   - Analytics is under Sales, matching where store-portal files its Store Analytics.
 *   - Product Received is fuel-tanker discharge (waybill, truck, depot, tank dips), which is
 *     stock arriving rather than a purchase report, so it is Stock.
 *   - Audit Report sits in Cash & Accounts. It is not store's "Activity" (a who-did-what log);
 *     it is a multi-sheet financial pack, and its sheets reach past cash into stock position
 *     and consumption. It lived in a group of its own for that reason, and a one-item group
 *     read as a mistake on screen, so it was moved here by decision. Its cash sheets
 *     (sales/cash position, lodgement sheet) are the ones that justify the placement.
 *
 * `column` is which side of the two-column desktop layout the group sits in. It is declared
 * here rather than left to the layout because the two are one decision: Sales and Stock read
 * as a pair (what was sold, what it was sold out of) and belong in the same column, which a
 * height-balancing layout would not know and would split wherever the rows happened to fall.
 * Below lg the columns stack and everything renders in this order regardless.
