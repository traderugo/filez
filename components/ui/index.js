 * Flat cards, 2px card border (border-card), square corners, one blue accent, semantic
 * tokens for light/dark. Screens compose these instead of re-deriving classes.

 * Two deliberate differences from store-portal's copy:
 *   - Links are next/link, not RippleLink. station-portal has no Ripple primitive, and
 *     adding tap-ripple to every row is a behaviour change, not a styling one.
 *   - Tile / HeroTile / Row take `allowed` + `onBlocked`. store filters destinations a member
 *     cannot open out of the nav entirely; station shows them dimmed and explains on tap.
 *
 * FilterRail is still not ported — no station screen has a filter column yet.
